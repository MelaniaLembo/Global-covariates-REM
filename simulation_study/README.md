## SIMULATION STUDY: 

2 simulation studies provided:

1. __Effects of sample size, network and shift distribution__

The folder "effects_sample_size_network_size_shift_distr" contains files for the code related to the simulation investigating the effect of sample size, network size and choice of shift distribution on the performance of the proposed approach (see README file in the folder for details).

2. __Comparison with a full likelihood approach__

The folder "comparison_full_likel" contains files for the code related to the simulation comparing the full likelihoood approach presented in Stadfelt and Block (2017) with the proposed approach (see README file in the folder for details).
