## SIMULATION STUDY: comparison with a full likelihood

Simulation aims at comparing our approach to the full-likelihood one presented in Stadtfeld and Block 2017 for the estimation of global effects.

__DIRECTORY STRUCTURE__

- full_likel_comparison.R: contains code for the data simulation the comparison is run on and the bias-reduced estimation for both the full-likelihood and our proposed partial likelihood. It also generates the plot included in the paper

__DIRECTORY USAGE__

Run full_likel_comparison.R. Plot is save in the same folder in pdf format.
